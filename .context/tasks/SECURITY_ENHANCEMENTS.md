# Task: Security Enhancements

## Description
Implement security improvements for the WhatsApp MCP Server project to protect sensitive data and ensure safe operation.

## Subtasks
- Encrypt sensitive data in SQLite and on disk.
- Add authentication and authorization to the Go bridge REST API.
- Implement audit logging for message access and actions.
- Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs (including file paths, recipient IDs, and message content).
- Restrict file operations to a dedicated media directory and sanitize file names.
- Redact or avoid logging sensitive data (messages, media paths, etc.).
- Add rate limiting and abuse protection to all endpoints.
- Use environment variables for secrets and sensitive configuration.
- Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities (supply chain security).

## Rationale
Protecting user data and controlling access is critical for privacy and compliance.
